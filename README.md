# Project Structure
* Controllers: The controllers for each models to handle the interaction with the database. This directory contains two versions of each controller, of which class [entityName]V2Controller uses a service to interact with the context of the database rather than interacting with the context directly
* Migrations: The database migrations that contains information about the database, tables and seeded data
* Models: Classes that represents the data of an entity within the database as well as DTO operations within the database
* Profiles: Profiles that contain the configurations for how the Automapper interacts with the DTO
* Services: Contains the service classes that interacts with the context and passes information through to the corresponding controller
