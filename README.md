# Textprocessor
This project showcases a part of a text processing library console.

The following assumptions and definitions limit the scope of the task:

### Word: 
To simplify, a word is represented by a sequence of one or more characters between „a‟
and „z‟ or between „A‟ and „Z‟. For example “agdfBh”.

### Letter Case: 
When counting the words, we are interested in the case insensitive counting (i.e.
in the text “The car in the garage should be repaired”, the library should count 2 occurrences for
any of the words “the” or “The” or “tHE” etc).

### Input Text: 
The input text contains words separated by various separator characters (space,
carriage returns, dots, commas). Note that the characters from „a‟ and „z‟ and from „A‟ and „Z‟
can only appear within words. The text will not contain any numbers.
